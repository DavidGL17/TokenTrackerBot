# TokenTrackerBot

This discord bot will allow you to track the value of the WoW Token, and warn you when it goes under a certain value

This is a work in progress, and is not yet ready for use.

Ideally it could also have a small web interface to allow users to set their own alerts, and see the current value of the token. For example using streamlit.

Using this [repo](https://github.com/thusimon/wowdev) as a reference for how to get the data from the WoW API.
